# Broken Promises 

## Media Hackday 2013 - Berlin

In 2003, an article in the New Scientist stated that bananas could be extinct in 2013. Guess what. This was yet another broken promise.

It can be hard to keep track of all promises and predictions. This tool makes it easier for journalists and citizens to keep an eye on what was promised for a certain date (a day, a month or a year). Articles from the Guardian and the New-York Times are searched for dates and then filtered to remove inadequate results (movie releases, for instance).

## Note

This is only the frontend system wich will show you articles. To retrieve them, we have build [broken-promises](https://github.com/jplusplus/broken-promises).
